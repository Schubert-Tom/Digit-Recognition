# CNN-Numbers

## Jupyter Notebook


  A jupyter notebook for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset
 
  * Accuaracy: 99% on random test data from the MNIST dataset 
  * A visualisation of the Loss-Function over the training process
  * Testplots
  * Autodownloader and split for the training and validation data

## Web Test-Application


  A streamlit Application for Testing the CNN
  
  Start the Application inside the `app` directory with:
  
  
```streamlit run app.py```  

 
  Draw your own numbers inside a canvas and let the CNN guess
